## Description:

Walk-Through Video: 

MongoDB has emerged as a favored database solution among numerous social networks owing to its remarkable speed in handling vast quantities of data and its adaptability in managing unstructured data. Since data serves as the fundamental building block of these applications. I was tasked with creating a Social Media API  where users can freely express their thoughts, and other users can respond to those thoughts in the form of “reactions”. Additionally, users should have the ability to curate their own list of connections/friends. To accomplish this, I utilized Express.js for handling routes, MongoDB database, and the Mongoose Object Data Modeling (ODM) library. Furthermore, MongoDB Compass was utilized to aid me in interacting with the NetBlend database in a user friendly format with query builders, and a real-time data preview. This application provided me with valuable hands-on experience in building a robust and efficient API for social networking platforms, so that users can seamlessly engage and share within the network.

This application brings together many different kinds of software and associated packages to create a dynamic Social Media API called “NetBlend”. NetBlend is a versatile application that empowers users to effortlessly manage their user accounts, thoughts or posts, reactions or comments, and interactions with other users. With NetBlend, users have the ability to create, read, update, and delete their own user accounts, as well as publish and manage their thoughts or posts. They can also engage with other users' thoughts through the integration of Insomnia, allowing them to fetch and leave reactions on those thoughts. Additionally, NetBlend offers a personalized experience by enabling users to conveniently add or remove other users from their network, fostering meaningful connections within the platform.This Social Media API holds all of the data for the soon to come NetBlend Social Media application.

### Installation:

To install this project, a knowledge of JavaScript, Node.js, and Express.js, MongoDB, Mongoose, MongoDB COmpass, and Insomnia  were required.  I had to first install Node.js to my computer and then install the Express and NPM packages. I installed the following dependencies with my npm install (express, moment.js, mongoose, and nodemon).The Express package allowed me to use the express framework in Node.js. In order to create this application. Methods used ranged from JavaScript, Node.js, NPM Packages, Routing, Functional Programming, Arrow Functions, Objects, Functions, Mongoose, MongooseDB, MongoDB Compass, Insomnia, Express.js. NetBlend is an application which gives users an opportunity to create, read, update, and delete their user accounts, thoughts or posts, as well as reactions or comments to those thoughts. In addition, users are able to fetch another user's thoughts through insomnia, and leave their reactions. Finally, users should be able to add and delete other users for a more personalized experience. The code below makes this happen. 


### Usage: 


As the market shifts towards embracing big data, companies are faced with the challenge of not only collecting vast amounts of information but also utilizing it to derive actionable insights. To enhance social media data analysis, integrating an API has emerged as a valuable solution. This application is the social media API for NetBlend, and acts as a remote database that users are able to directly interact with by making accounts, adding friends, and sharing their thoughts and reactions to other users’ thoughts and reactions. In the realm of social media data analysis, APIs allow companies to connect to various platforms. Even big companies such as Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram, grant access to diverse datasets through their dynamic APIs. 

The use of NetBlend offers two significant benefits. Firstly, it saves a substantial amount of time and effort by eliminating the need to set up independent data collection infrastructure. Secondly, it provides greater control over the data being collected. By integrating NetBlend, programmers and even users are able to manipulate the database and collected data in a centralized location as well as leverage the NetBlend data to monitor public sentiment, identify potential issues, and extract valuable insights from user data. 


Overall, this application encourages community and user interaction in the form of a Social Media API. Users are able to friend each other, add thoughts and reactions to other users thoughts, and manage their own data. When it comes to social media data analysis, integrating the NetBlend API can prove to be a valuable asset. This API not only enables you to gather more precise and accurate data but also streamlines the entire data collection process, saving you valuable time and effort. By leveraging the capabilities of the NetBlend API, you can enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of your social media data analysis, enabling you to make more informed decisions and extract actionable insights from the vast amount of data available.
