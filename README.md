## Description:

Walk-Through Video: 

MongoDB has emerged as a favored database solution among numerous social networks owing to its remarkable speed in handling vast quantities of data and its adaptability in managing unstructured data. Since data serves as the fundamental building block of these applications. I was tasked with creating a Social Media API  where users can freely express their thoughts, and other users can respond to those thoughts in the form of “reactions”. Additionally, users should have the ability to curate their own list of connections/friends. To accomplish this, I utilized Express.js for handling routes, MongoDB database, and the Mongoose Object Data Modeling (ODM) library. Furthermore, MongoDB Compass was utilized to aid me in interacting with the NetBlend database in a user friendly format with query builders, and a real-time data preview. This application provided me with valuable hands-on experience in building a robust and efficient API for social networking platforms, so that users can seamlessly engage and share within the network.
